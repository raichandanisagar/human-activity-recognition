# Human Activity Recognition for management of Lower Back Pain

Lower back pain is an increasingly common, expensive, and debilitating condition that affects all age groups. Inspired by the works of Sani, Wiratunga, et al. on the SELFBACK system for Lower Back Pain management, my objective through this project is to develop a subject-indepent (unseen user) classifier that identifies four physical activity types (sedentary, walking, ascending/descending stairs and running) through a wrist-bound accelerometer's readings. The dataset was compiled by the team of the original paper and sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/selfBACK).
